# Starwars Star Profile App

This is borrowed from "https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-react-and-redux/introduction"
A tutorial to practice on redux.

It is adopted from the Starwars movie and you are able to click on character and generate a profile, the movies they have featured in and the worlds in which they appeared.

NB: ensure you have CORS installed on the browser and that they are ON.
